Presets can be changed in the Presets.json file :

- args can be changed according to ryzenadj
- shortcuts can be changed for free
- defaultPreset can be “silence”, “turbo”, “lastPreset”
- lastPreset can be changed, it saves the active preset
- showTray can be changed for free
- showOverlay can be changed for free
- startup can be changed for free
- liveEdit can be changed, this means that you can change the values in Presets.json in real time, and the program will handle it
- updateRate can be changed, this means how often settings will be checked and re-applied (if needs). It is done because sometimes the CPU resets the values provided by ryzenadj
