Icons can be changed in the Resources folder.

Presets can be changed in the Presets.json file:

- args can be changed according to ryzenadj
- shortcuts can be changed for free
- showTray can be changed for free
- showOverlay can be changed for free
- defaultPreset can be “silence”, “turbo”, “lastPreset”.
- lastPreset can be changed, it saves the active preset
- updateRate can be changed, the frequency of re-reading the configuration and re-applying settings has been changed. This means that you can change the values in Presets.json in real time, and the program will handle it. Reapplying the settings is done because sometimes the CPU resets the values provided by ryzenadj.
